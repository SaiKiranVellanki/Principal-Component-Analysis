# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Project

## Introduction
This project explores Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. The Jupyter notebook includes both theoretical explanations and practical examples, demonstrating how PCA can be applied to data dimensionality reduction and feature extraction.

## Project Structure
The notebook is structured to provide a comprehensive guide to PCA, including:

- **Markdown Cells**: Explain the theory behind PCA, its importance, and its applications in data science and machine learning.
- **Code Cells**: Showcase how to implement PCA using Python, covering data preparation, PCA computation, and visualization of the results.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need:
- Python 3.6 or later
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Python libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`
